# OpenARLog
Open source Amateur Radio logging Application for Windows

OpenARLog: This project contains the front-end code, including the UI. So far, only a basic
non-functional interface has been implemented.

OpenARLog.ADIF: This project contains the library for importing and exporting from the ADIF file
format.

OpenARLog.Data: This project contains the library for handling the data internally and interfacing
with the SQLite database.

These are still in their early development. The UI is unusable, Data is only partially developed.
Work will be focused on finishing the back end before the UI will be completed.

#Dependencies
