# OpenARLog
Open source Amateur Radio logging Application for Windows

This is still very early in development. The UI is completely unusable right now. Just the design
has been implemented, no functionality yet. Most work has been done on the database.

#Dependencies
EntityFramework
System.Data.SQLite

Get both from VS NuGet Package Manager.

#Building
Just open the solution in Visual Studio, build and run.
